This is a collection of my .dotfiles for ZSH, VIM (and MacVim) & GIT.

Here are the steps to ensure a successful installation and thus, a sweet setup.

1. Install the excellent [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).
  You can do this easily by:
  $ wget --no-check-certificate https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | sh

2. Clone this repository.
3.  $ rake install
